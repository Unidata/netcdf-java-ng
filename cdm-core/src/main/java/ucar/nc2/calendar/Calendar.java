 * 
 * You should use a true calendar package rather than the UDUNITS-2 package to handle time. Having said that, many
 * people use the time-handling capabilities of the UDUNITS-2 package because it supports CDM.UNITS like
 * "seconds since 1970-01-01".
 * You should be aware, however, that the hybrid Gregorian/Julian calendar used by the UDUNITS-2 package cannot be
 * changed.
 * Dates on or after 1582-10-15 are assumed to be Gregorian dates; dates before that are assumed to be Julian dates.
 * In particular, the year 1 BCE is immediately followed by the year 1 CE.

 * 
 * In order to calculate a new date and time given a base date, base time and a time increment one must know what
 * calendar to use. For this purpose we recommend that the calendar be specified by the attribute calendar which is
 * assigned to the time coordinate variable. The values currently defined for calendar are:
 * 
 * gregorian or standard
 * Mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar as defined by Udunits. This is the default.
 * 
 * proleptic_gregorian
 * A Gregorian calendar extended to dates before 1582-10-15. That is, a year is a leap year if either (i) it is
 * divisible by 4 but not by 100 or (ii) it is divisible by 400.
 * 
 * noleap or 365_day
 * Gregorian calendar without leap years, i.e., all years are 365 days long.
 * 
 * all_leap or 366_day
 * Gregorian calendar with every year being a leap year, i.e., all years are 366 days long.
 * 
 * 360_day
 * All years are 360 days divided into 30 day months.
 * 
 * julian
 * Julian calendar.
 * 
 * none
 * No calendar.
 * 
 * The calendar attribute may be set to none in climate experiments that simulate a fixed time of year. The time of year
 * is indicated by the date in the reference time of the units attribute. The time coordinate that might apply in a
 * perpetual July experiment are given in the following example.
 * 
 * Example 4.5. Perpetual time axis
 * variables:
 * double time(time) ;
 * time:long_name = "time" ;
 * time:units = "days since 1-7-15 0:0:0" ;
 * time:calendar = "none" ;
 * data:
 * time = 0., 1., 2., ...;
 * 
 * Here, all days simulate the conditions of 15th July, so it does not make sense to give them different dates. The time
 * coordinates are interpreted as 0, 1, 2, etc. days since the start of the experiment.
 * 
 * If none of the calendars defined above applies (e.g., calendars appropriate to a different paleoclimate era), a
 * non-standard calendar can be defined. The lengths of each month are explicitly defined with the month_lengths
 * attribute of the time axis:
 * 
 * month_lengths
 * A vector of size 12, specifying the number of days in the months from January to December (in a non-leap year).
 * 
 * If leap years are included, then two other attributes of the time axis should also be defined:
 * 
 * leap_year
 * An example of a leap year. It is assumed that all years that differ from this year by a multiple of four are also
 * leap years. If this attribute is absent, it is assumed there are no leap years.
 * 
 * leap_month
 * A value in the range 1-12, specifying which month is lengthened by a day in leap years (1=January). If this attribute
 * is not present, February (2) is assumed. This attribute is ignored if leap_year is not specified.
 * 
 * The calendar attribute is not required when a non-standard calendar is being used. It is sufficient to define the
 * calendar using the month_lengths attribute, along with leap_year, and leap_month as appropriate. However, the
 * calendar attribute is allowed to take non-standard values and in that case defining the non-standard calendar using
 * the appropriate attributes is required.
 * 
 * Example 4.6. Paleoclimate time axis
 * double time(time) ;
 * time:long_name = "time" ;
 * time:units = "days since 1-1-1 0:0:0" ;
 * time:calendar = "126 kyr B.P." ;
 * time:month_lengths = 34, 31, 32, 30, 29, 27, 28, 28, 28, 32, 32, 34 ;
 * 
 * The mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar used by Udunits is explained in the following excerpt from the udunits(3) man
 * page:
 * 
 * The udunits(3) package uses a mixed Gregorian/Julian calen-
 * dar system. Dates prior to 1582-10-15 are assumed to use
 * the Julian calendar, which was introduced by Julius Caesar
 * in 46 BCE and is based on a year that is exactly 365.25 days
 * long. Dates on and after 1582-10-15 are assumed to use the
 * Gregorian calendar, which was introduced on that date and is
 * based on a year that is exactly 365.2425 days long. (A year
 * is actually approximately 365.242198781 days long.) Seem-
 * ingly strange behavior of the udunits(3) package can result
 * if a user-given time interval includes the changeover date.
 * For example, utCalendar() and utInvCalendar() can be used to
 * show that 1582-10-15 *preceded* 1582-10-14 by 9 days.
 * 
 * Due to problems caused by the discontinuity in the default mixed Gregorian/Julian calendar, we strongly recommend
 * that this calendar should only be used when the time coordinate does not cross the discontinuity. For time
 * coordinates that do cross the discontinuity the proleptic_gregorian calendar should be used instead.
