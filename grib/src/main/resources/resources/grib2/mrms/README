convert_mrms_table.py

Will read in the csv table of GRIB 2 parameters and ouput a block of text that can be used in the init method of
grib/src/main/java/ucar/nc2/grib/grib2/table/MrmsLocalTables.java.

The script does some simple processing (fixing spelling typos, units like "table", etc.). The csv version of the
table can be found at:

https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/mrms/operational/tables.php

The actual file is currently is hosted on an ftp server:

ftp://ftp.nssl.noaa.gov/projects/MRMS/GRIB2_TABLES/UserTable_MRMS_v12.0.csv

  - Updated to version 12.0 of the MRMS GRIB2 parameter table.

  - "Hotfix" for the version 12 GIRB table. Confirmed by NSSL (Carrie Langston). From email:

      "The values you're seeing are correct. The following FLASH products use -9999:
       FLASH_CREST_MAXSOILSAT
       FLASH_CREST_MAXSTREAMFLOW
       FLASH_CREST_MAXUNITSTREAMFLOW
       FLASH_HP_MAXSTREAMFLOW
       FLASH_HP_MAXUNITSTREAMFLOW
       FLASH_SAC_MAXSOILSAT
       FLASH_SAC_MAXSTREAMFLOW
       FLASH_SAC_MAXUNITSTREAMFLOW"

   Will probably show up in the 12.1 update, but wanted to get this out now. Will remove once "officially" released.
